# Concert-Ticket-Reservation-System
My first functional project created in C++ a year ago, can occasionally lead to infinite loops but it is well documented and uses a multidimensional dynamic array for its main feature.
The program creates two arrays based on user input and then any part of the array can be selected to reserve a spot on the "concert."
A random key is then created that is used to retrieve the reservation and cancel it.
